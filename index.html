        <p>Our team was tasked with developing a mobile app that solves a real, clearly identified need in users’ everyday lives. After narrowing down brainstormed ideas to the topic of physical and mental health, we landed on a mobile app that allows users to search and join exercise groups in their community in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>

        <h2 class="featurette-heading">User Persona</h2>
        <p class="lead">The team developed a User Persona which was a compilation of all our user research into one target user for Road app. Description of our user below:
        <p class="lead"><i>Pam is a full-time Account Manager for an advertising agency who works remotely from her home in Toronto. She spends most of her time working with her team on various projects, while her downtime is spent connecting with friends, running her photography blog, or working on her physical and mental health. She lives with her partner but has been physically removed from many of her usual connections both at work and in her social circle due to Covid-19 restrictions.</p></i>
        <p class="lead"><b>Pain Points:</b> Doesn't know how or where to meet people to exercise with / Is often busy with work / Pandemic has reduced the amount of time she spends exercising / Is afraid to exercise by herself in public spaces / Struggles to find motivation to workout alone.</p>

<!--Prototype-->   
<hr class="featurette-divider">
<div class="row featurette">
  <div class="col-md-7 order-md-2">
    <h2 class="featurette-heading">Prototype</h2>
    <p class="lead">The team first developed a User Flow for how users would typically use the app to login, find, and join an event of their liking. Each team member created sketches of the onboarding process and these were developed into wireframes on Figma. We voted on the top frames and strung these together into a lo-fi prototype that was used for guerilla testing.</p>
    <p class="lead">This prototype was tested on 5 users to help us understand any pain points when using the app to complete certain tasks and general attitudes towards the design/usability.</p>

      <div class="col-md-7">
        <h2 class="featurette-heading">Iterations</h2>
        <p class="lead">From our User Tests, we were able to take the most common feedback and apply to our iterations of the prototype. These included:</p>
        <p class="lead">1. Filter frame was overwhelming and confusing to users; requires more explanation up front.</p>
        <p class="lead">2. Search bar needs to be better positioned within frame (users were unsure if the search bar is to search by locations or search by activities).</p>
        <p class="lead">3. Users confused about "Add to Wishlist" vs. "Add to Calendar" features; provide more explanation for these features.</p>
        <p class="lead">From our user tests, we were able to redefine problems and solutions based on our user’s pains and concerns. We also prioritized our work according to feasibility while keeping our user’s perspective in mind, and considerably improved the features of the design of our app to make it easier to understand and use.</p>
